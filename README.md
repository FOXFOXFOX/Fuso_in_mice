# Fuso_in_mice
This repo contains data, metadata, analysis code and figures for the first three  experiments in which I infected mice with Fusobacterium nucleatum 

###Summary update, 7/19/16:###
I have completed the analysis for the third fusobacterium experiment. In brief, in this experiment I infected mice daily with 10^8 CFU Fusobacterium for 5 days. The mice had either been pretreated with DSS or kept on either a high or low concentration of Vancomycin throughout the infection. At day 3 and day 10 (following a 5 day recovery period) I sacrificed the mice and harvested cecum, cecal content, stool and colon tissue. I isolated DNA and ran 16S on the samples. 

In general, there was very few reads overall for the fusobacterium input strain. The mice did seem to contain a number of other Fusobacterium strains in higher abundance than the input strain, but overall the amount of reads for the entire experiment was low, ~400 reads total for the highest OTU. One concern about the sequencing is that there were levels of non-nucleatum Fusobacterium strains found in the negative sequencing controls. These appear to be human stool contaminants, something I had observed in the previous mouse experiments. Because of the contamination and low abundance, any Fuosbacterium sample we see is not likely to be the ATCC input nucleatum subsp nucleatum strain. Thus this experiment did not show that Fusobacterium was able to colonize these mice. 

### **Project next steps:**
Though I did not have much striking data to present at Anaerobe, I did get some good suggestions for how to move forward. A number of people suggested that we switch to the Apc min mouse model, as these are the only mice published on to be able to host Fusobacterium in their gut. I also met with Cindy Sears who pointed me to her lab's newest paper where they are able to get Fuso to colonize a WT mouse using a different antibiotic regimen. Additionally, I am still interested in pursuing a better quantification technique that does not at least at first rely on 16S sequencing as even with this most sensitive method I haven't been able to glean insights from this project. 

In the short-term, I'm going to read the newest Sears paper and see if we might be able to adapt their model to our interests. She has also offered to send her the strain they use for their mice, which is a Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp nucleatum strain but has not been fully sequenced (human isolate). However I have other projects to focus on and don't think I will pick up the Fusobacterium one again until significant progress is made with the KWS analysis and paper. 

I will though do the basic oxygen sensitivity characterization tests we discussed at my chalk talk, and, finally the GF core is nearly ready to do the GF experiment so that will be able to take place with little effort on my part.
