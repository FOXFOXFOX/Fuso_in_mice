OTU analysis with Niel

OTU00110 appears to be the innoculum, BLASTs to an animalis strain, Emma's lab papers
show that the EAVG002 are closest to animalis 

Other OTUs are different fuso types so can exclude those from analysis. still odd
that there are so much fuso other subtypes in mouse background

Only plot OTU110 now instead of fuso sums 

make a stripchart of OTU110 rel abundance at 48 hr per location 
colon, uninfected/infected side by side. 

OTU110/12 to get % abundance 

next steps:
qPCR, primer specificity? even in "negative" controls there are other species 
culture same issues
16S going forward or ? 
repeat experiment?
