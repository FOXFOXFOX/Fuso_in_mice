Thursday analysis and experiment notes:

OTU00110 appears to be the innoculum, BLASTs to an animalis strain, Emma's lab papers
show that the EAVG002 are closest to animalis. 

The V4 region of the EAVG-002 innoculum strain is:
ACGTATGTCACGAGCGTTATCCGGATTTATTGGGCGTAAAGCGCGTCTAGGTGGT
TATGTAAGTCTGATGTGAAAATGCAGGGCTCAACTCTGTATTGCGTTGGAAACTG
TATAACTAGAGTACTGGAGAGGTAAGCGGAACTACAAGTGTAGAGGTGAAATTCG
TAGATATTTGTAGGAATGCCGATGGGGAAGCCAGCTTACTGGACAGATACTGACG
CTAAAGCGCGAAAGCGTGGGTAGCAAACAGG 

The full 16S sequence is NCBI 4_8 or 21_1A from the EAV paper

The other OTUs are different subspecies of F. nucleatum and so we can treat those as 
background and exclude them from analysis. 
But wait- are these found in experiment 2 as well?
and why is there so much human Fuso in the mouse background?
Fuso at t = 0???

 
Analysis plans before meeting with Pat:
1) make a stripchart of OTU110 rel abundance at 48 hr per location 
colon, uninfected/infected side by side for each experiment 
- OTU110/12 to get % abundance 

Project next steps:
Need to find a better way than 16S to quantify. now that we have "controls" we could design an assay
BUT:
	-qPCR won't be able to get good specificity w primers, even in "negative" controls there are other species
		~try taqman probes, we might already have primers, need to check w Nick 
	-similar issues with culturing
	-can still try the broth subculturing experiments in antibiotic, compare output side by side
		fuso WT and fuso stool
	-GFP labeled fuso or antibiotic tagged with a transposon? This would be cool
		~anaerobic GFP is expensive. checking with Eric Martens about this. could try other ways
		~quantify in plate reader based on fluorescence, would be cool
		~gets around background issue 
		~would exposure to oxygen affect fuso viability if going to culture after?
	
Several options going forward (while also troubleshooting other assays):
1) repeat this/these experiments as done before, 16S to see if this was just some infeciton error
2) redo 8week gavage model, shorter even, try to prove that the other model itself even works
3) look into cloning, GFP experiments
4) try other antibiotics for mice to be on
5) germ free mouse experiments?
